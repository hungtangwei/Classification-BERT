# Classification-BERT
Classification problem with BERT

The aim of this challenge is to develop a classifier that can assign a set of twitter texts to their corresponding labels. In this task, I will focus on the gender classification task, where you are required to develop a classifier that can identify the gender of the tweetâ€™s author as accurate as possible.

# Dataset
* train_labels.csv: contains training ids and gender. It contains twitter posts from 3,100 authors and acts as the training data.
* test_labels.csv: contains test ids and gender. It contains the twitter posts from 500 authors. 
* data.zip: contains 3,600 twitter texts for those authors, which acts as the training and testing data.
