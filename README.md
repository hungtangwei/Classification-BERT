# Classification-BERT

The aim of this challenge is to develop a classifier that can assign a set of twitter texts to their corresponding labels. In this task, I will focus on the gender classification task, where I  develop a classifier that can identify the gender of the tweet’s author as accurate as possible.

## Analysis code

Key elements of the analysis code are as follows:
- *Gender_Classifiction_Bert.ipynb* - a Python script used to build the gender classifier with BERT.
- *data.zip* - a zip file contains 3,600 twitter texts for those authors, which acts as the training and testing data.
- *train_labels.csv* – a csv file contains training ids and gender. It contains twitter posts from 3,100 authors and acts as the training data.
- *test_labels.csv* - a csv file contains test ids and gender. It contains the twitter posts from 500 authors.
